# Trivia Bot

This project consists of:

**Trivia Bot** (`app.py`):  
   A Python service that OCRs your mirrored screen region, parses out the question and options, calls an LLM (via OpenAIâ€™s API) to pick the correct answer, and clicks that option on the screen.
---
   Flask app for a UI to easily enter in keyword trigger, active trigger, screen region coordinates/size, and enable/disable scrolling feature (if trivia game type is one page with many questions or one question on the screen at a time).
   Along with a simple "Trivia Bot On/Off" toggle to start/stop the bot.

   Note: Currently only works on Mac OS, due to use of Apple's Vision and Quartz frameworks.
