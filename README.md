# BWW Trivia Bot

This project consists of:

**Trivia Bot** (`app.py`):  
   A Python service that OCRs your mirrored screen region, parses out the question and options, calls an LLM (via OpenAIâ€™s API) to pick the correct answer, and clicks that option on the screen.
---
   Flask app for a UI to easily enter in keyword trigger, active trigger, screen region coordinates/size, and mouse click offsets/spacing.
   Along with a simple "Trivia Bot On/Off" toggle to start/stop the bot.
